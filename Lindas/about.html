    <h1>Linda's</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Linda’s is a family-owned business, originally a small tortillería run by a Mexican immigrant family. Now, the second-generation owner, Linda, has taken over and wants to turn it into a modern Tex-Mex diner that appeals to the new, gentrified neighborhood while staying true to its roots. With high rent prices, she renamed the business but wants to maintain the traditions of her family.</p>
